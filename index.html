              <p>The map on the left shows all routes flown out of Melbourne Airport, which can be further decomposed based on selected years and regions.</p>
              <p>Given Melbourne's geographic positon, routes to Asia and New Zealand are plentiful.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the all-time busiest route out of Melbourne Airport, with 7.5 million passengers flying there since 2009. Melbourne to Singapore has been the busiest route across all years, with the exception of 2020, when Auckland briefly became the most popular destination.</p>

              <p>The bubble plot below the line chart shows the trend in passenger traffic across various global regions.

On the other hand, there's now no flights to Africa and South America.</p>

              <p>The scatterplot on the left shows international routes out of Melbourne Airport, ordered by passengers flown (y-axis) and the average load/seat occupancy factor (x-axis).</p>
              <p>At first glance, it's apparent that the busiest routes often have the highest seat occupancy, in addition to being highly competitive. As a region, South-East Asia performs the strongest across all indicators, with routes such as those to Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City and Denpasar/Bali.</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">(You can click anywhere on the scatterplot to view other regions, or you can click on the legend.)</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Furthermore, the scatterplot also highlights niche routes with a high seat occupancy but slightly fewer passengers. For March 2023, these include routes to Hong Kong, Honolulu and Hanoi, where only one airline operates. Destinations such as these could be considered to be of a 'seasonal' nature. Only one airline operates on the aforementioned busy routes, so it's likely that Melburnians may see more competition entering the market in due course.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the scatterplot also highlights ostensibly unsuccessful routes during March 2023, such as those to Osaka and select Chinese cities (all North-East Asian cities). This may be due to China's delayed re-opening after COVID-19. Changing the time filter to the COVID-19 lockdown period would also highlight that many routes often had paltry seat occupancy in the low teens. For example, flights to Doha during the COVID-19 pandemic were only about 10% full - quite a relevant observation considering the recent rejection of additional flights by the Australian Government.</p>
        <p>(Please also note that data for London is slightly misleading as the seat occupancy factor only accounts for people flying from Melbourne to London on the same flight number.)</p>

              <p>The index chart on the left shows the inflation-adjusted change in price, by class of travel, based on the chosen year index. The price index is based on the busiest 70 domestic routes and only looks at the chepeast airfare available on the last Thursday of each month.</p>
              <p>Definitions (Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics, 2023-a):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Best Discount: </strong>Cheapest airfare across all classes, excluding baggage surcharges.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Class: </strong>Cheapest Business Class fare.</li>
          <li><strong>Full Economy: </strong>Cheapest Economy fare that is fully flexible and refundable (discontinued after 2015).</li>
          <li><strong>Restricted Economy: </strong>Cheapest Economy fare that comes with some restrictions (i.e., one level below fully flexible).</li>

        <p>High airfares have been in the news lately, particularly as there's been a senate inquiry into the Australian federal government's decision to deny Qatar Airways the ability to fly an additional 28 weekly routes to major Australian airports. International airfares, particularly those to Eurppe, are now significantly higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic (Webber, 2023).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, data for international airfares is not available, though data for domestic airfares is indeed available and can be used a barometer to gauge the overall state of Australian airfares.</p>
        <p>Looking at the price index, it's apparent that there's been an overall inflation-adjusted decline in prices since 1992. Even when compared to 2019, only Best Discount fares are marginally more expensive. While this may seem counter-intuitive, it's improtant to note the methodology used by BITRE (2023): only the cheapest published airfares on the last Thursday of each month are taken into account. These price indices don't necessarily reflect the airfares paid by the average domestic traveller, as such data is not reported by airlines.</p>
        <p>However, it's also important to note that the price index is inflation-adjusted. Given currency inflation over the last couple of years, the average traveller would 'feel' that they're now paying more for airfares, even if prices have remained stable in real terms. As such, discussions regarding high airfares after the COVID-19 pandemic should also take the role of currency inflation into account.</p>

              <p>The normalised bar chart on the left shows the international flight market share held by each airline, based on total seats flown out of Melbourne Airport.</p>
              <p>As expected, the Qantas Group (Qantas Airways and Jetstar) is the most dominant at Melbourne Airport. Their position is further complemented by Emirates, who are partnered with the Qantas Group. Other key players such as Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways also command a formidable market share.</p>
              <p>At the time of wiring this (14 October 2023), the Australian Government have been criticised for denying Qatar Airways an additional 28 weekly flights into major Australian Airports, on top of the 21 weekly flights they currently operate (Merket, 2023).</p>
              <p>Critics of the decision have cited that additional flights would've reduced airfares and that the additional flights would've otherwise boosted the Australian economy by bringing additional tourists. Qatar Airways, for their part, have mentioend that they kept flying to Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite very low traveller numbers (Al Jazeera, 2023).</p>
              <p>(Looking at the Figure B from above would show that flights to Doha were only around 10% occupied on average during the pandemic years.)</p>
              <p>In what is a shocking indictment of Qantas, during 2021, a year wherein travel to Australia was severely restricted until mid-November, Qatar Airways flew out more than twice as many seats as did Qantas, which is supposedly considered to be Australia's "national airline!"</p>

        <p>Such findings make a persuasive argument for Qatar Airways being granted additional flights to major Australian airports. At least based on the available data, it seems that Qatar Airways kept flying out planes that were only around 10% full, over a vast distance, at a time when Australians had been left 'abandoned' by their "national airline." While these additional flights would ultimately pad Qatar Airways' bottom line, it's also important to consider their positive impact on international airfares and on the Australian tourism industry (Merket, 2023).</p>
